# Enabling gene prediction and annotation in eukaryotes
In this section of the course, an introduction to how gene annotation is performed in 2022 is presented. The type of data to be used include Illumina reads from NextSeq 500.
This section of the course includes:
* Obtaining data
* Quality control
* Preprocessing (trimming)
* Perform structural and functional annotations
* Evaluation

The data to be anlyzed in this section comes from the paper: [A chromosome-scale assembly of the smallest Dothideomycete genome reveals a unique genome compaction mechanism in filamentous fungi](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-020-6732-8 "Wang et al. BMC Genomics 21:321 (2020)").

The approach for this section will be modular. Thus, a long script is not going to be provide but you can make your own.
