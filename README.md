# Enabling gene prediction and annotation in eukaryotes
In this code, gene annotation is performed for eukaryotes from a 2020 paper. The type of data to be used include Illumina reads from NextSeq 500.
This section of the course includes:
* Obtaining data
* Quality control
* Preprocessing (trimming)
* Perform structural and functional annotations
* Evaluation

The data to be anlyzed in this section comes from the paper: [A chromosome-scale assembly of the smallest Dothideomycete genome reveals a unique genome compaction mechanism in filamentous fungi](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-020-6732-8 "Wang et al. BMC Genomics 21:321 (2020)").
